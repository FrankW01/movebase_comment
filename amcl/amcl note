reading guide:
    ??? means questions
    entry means where to read from
    this note is just for inspiration, comprehensive notes 
    can be seen before func declaration or start of the files

sensor---->odom
      ---->laser
sensor class provide interface for all sensors
typical interfaces: 
    data, only store a pointer to sensor 
    sensor func: 
        updateAction
odom: updateAction, pf samples x,y,theta is udpated here, following odom with some error
    it's recommanded to read codes with amcl_odom.png to understand it.
laser: updateSensor, calculate a total weight, each sample will divide by it

all key pf calculation is done in laserReceived.

to do: read outlook of amcl, details of pf algorithm, and ros fundamental lib, tf etc
    try to understand laserReceived

amcl transforms incoming laser scans to the odometry frame (~odom_frame_id). 
So there must exist a path through the tf tree from the frame in which the laser scans are published to the odometry frame.
An implementation detail: on receipt of the first laser scan, amcl looks up the transform between the laser's frame and the 
base frame (~base_frame_id), and latches it forever. So amcl cannot handle a laser that moves with respect to the base.
The drawing below shows the difference between localization using odometry and amcl. During operation amcl estimates the 
transformation of the base frame (~base_frame_id) in respect to the global frame (~global_frame_id) 
but it only publishes the transform between the global frame and the odometry frame (~odom_frame_id). 

pf cluster??? todo: pf datatype
pf current_set: only changed in resample func and always used when referred to set.

ok, understand pf, kd-tree is the key.
